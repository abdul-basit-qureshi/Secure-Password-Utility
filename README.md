# Securing Password Tool
## Introduction
This tool is a Python-based GUI application built using the Tkinter library. This program provides two primary functionalities:

1. **Random Password Generator**: Allows users to generate random passwords with customizable options (length, inclusion of uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters). The strength of the generated password is also evaluated and displayed.

2. **Secure Password Transformation**: Users can input their password to be "secured" by transforming certain characters into more secure alternatives (e.g., 'a' to '@', 's' to '$'). The strength of the transformed password is also evaluated and displayed.

## Features
- Generate a random password with user-defined criteria:
  - Choose the password length.
  - Include/exclude uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
  - Evaluate the password's strength (Weak, Moderate, Strong).
- Secure an existing password:
  - Replace common characters in a password with secure alternatives.
  - Evaluate the password's strength (Weak, Moderate, Strong).
